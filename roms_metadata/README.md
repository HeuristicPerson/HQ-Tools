--Put meta-data files here--

This meta-data files with information about ROMSETs are generated using "datextra", another private project of mine.
What that program does is merging different meta-dat files containing single values (year, manufacturer...) for each
ROMSET. By now, the only public part of that project are the meta-dat files for years that you can update here:
